Imagine your school needs more classrooms because there are too many students!

EKS is like the land where the school is built.
Karpenter is like a smart builder who knows when to build more classrooms and when to take some down.
Nodes are like the classrooms in the school.
When there are more students (like more apps needing to run), Karpenter sees that and builds a new classroom (a new node). If a classroom is empty for a long time, Karpenter can take it down to save space and money.
## installation
```Bash

helm repo add karpenter https://charts.karpenter.sh
helm repo update
helm install karpenter karpenter/karpenter \
  --namespace karpenter \
  --create-namespace \
  --set serviceAccount.create=true \
  --set controller.clusterName=<your-cluster-name> \
  --set controller.clusterEndpoint=<your-cluster-endpoint>
```
``Nodepool`` is like a blueprint for the classroom. It tells Karpenter:

What kind of classroom to build: Big or small? With desks or with tables?
Where to build it: On the ground floor or on the first floor?
Special rules for the classroom: Maybe only students with certain badges can use this classroom.
EC2NodeClass is like a detailed instruction manual for the classroom. It tells Karpenter things like:

What color to paint the walls: Should it be blue, green, or yellow?
What kind of chairs to use: Should they be soft chairs or hard chairs?
Where to put the lights: Should they be on the ceiling or on the walls?
Karpenter uses the Nodepool and EC2NodeClass to build the perfect classroom for the students. This way, everyone has a place to learn and the school doesn't waste space or money!

### Uses:

Nodepool: Helps Karpenter decide what kind of nodes to create and where to put them.
EC2NodeClass: Gives Karpenter very specific instructions on how to build the nodes.
This makes sure that the "classrooms" (nodes) are just right for the "students" (apps) and that the "school" (EKS) runs smoothly!


### 1. Nodepool YAML Example

```YAML

apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1beta1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: my-nodepool
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      nodeClassRef:
        name: my-nodeclass
      requirements:
      - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-category
        operator: In
        values: ["c", "m"] # Choose instances from c and m families
      - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
        operator: In
        values: ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
      taints:
      - key: my-special-taint
        effect: NoSchedule
```
### Explanation:

``apiVersion:`` This tells Kubernetes what version of the NodePool definition we're using.

``kind:`` This specifies that we're creating a NodePool object.

``metadata.name:`` This is a unique name for our NodePool.

``spec.template.metadata.labels:`` These labels will be added to any nodes created by this NodePool.

``spec.template.spec.nodeClassRef.name:`` This links the NodePool to an EC2NodeClass named "my-nodeclass".

``spec.template.spec.requirements:`` These are rules for the nodes:

Only use instances from the "c" and "m" families (like c5.large, m5.xlarge).  
Only create nodes in the "us-west-2a" and "us-west-2b" zones.  
``spec.template.spec.taints:`` This adds a "taint" to the nodes. Taints are like special marks that can prevent certain applications from running on the node unless they have a matching "tolerance".  

### 2. EC2NodeClass YAML Example

```YAML

apiVersion: karpenter.k8s.aws/v1beta1
kind: EC2NodeClass
metadata:
  name: my-nodeclass
spec:
  amiFamily: AL2 # Use Amazon Linux 2
  subnetSelectorTerms:
  - tags:
      karpenter.sh/discovery: my-cluster
  securityGroupSelectorTerms:
  - tags:
      karpenter.sh/discovery: my-cluster
```
### Explanation:

``apiVersion:`` This tells Kubernetes what version of the EC2NodeClass definition we're using.   
``kind:`` This specifies that we're creating an EC2NodeClass object.   
``metadata.name:`` This is a unique name for our EC2NodeClass (must match the one in the NodePool).   
``spec.amiFamily: ``This tells Karpenter to use the Amazon Linux 2 operating system for the nodes.   
``spec.subnetSelectorTerms:`` This tells Karpenter to place the nodes in subnets with the tag karpenter.sh/discovery: my-cluster.   
``spec.securityGroupSelectorTerms:`` This tells Karpenter to apply security groups with the tag karpenter.sh/discovery: my-cluster to the nodes.
